## About Me

Hello! I'm Artemy, an enthusiastic student deeply immersed in the realms of machine learning and artificial intelligence. My journey began with the exploration of fundamental machine learning concepts, and since then, I've delved into neural networks and deep learning.

### My Interests

- 🤖 **Machine Learning**: Exploring various machine learning methods such as classification, regression, and clustering. Working with algorithms like Random Forest, Support Vector Machines, and Gradient Boosting.

- 🧠 **Neural Networks**: In-depth study of neural network architectures, including Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) for image processing and Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN) for sequential data. Experimenting with generative models like Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN).

- 🚀 **Deep Learning**: Investigating the capabilities of deep learning for solving complex tasks, including transfer learning and ensemble methods.

- 📊 **Data Analysis and Visualization**: Applying tools for data analysis such as Pandas and NumPy, and creating visualizations using Matplotlib, and more advanced tools like Plotly.

- 🌐 **Natural Language Processing (NLP)**: Studying methods for analyzing and processing textual data, including topic modeling, sentiment analysis, and building chatbots.

### My Goals

My primary goal is to become a Data Scientist and apply my knowledge to analyze data, create predictive models, and solve real-world business challenges. I strive for continuous learning to stay abreast of the latest trends in machine learning and apply them to my work.
